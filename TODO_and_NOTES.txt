Design documentation, etc.
==========================
* Will be customizing admin interface for both end-users and admin-users. So, taking
the example of change form showing book info: a regular site user will not be
able to edit author, title, etc., but admin user  *would* see those fields
as editable (though they of course would not see the vote numbers fields as
editable)
