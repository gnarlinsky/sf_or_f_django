* tweak debug-toolbar settings in settings.py

* so I feel increasingly weird about just using the admin interface.... so, following http://www.tryolabs.com/Blog/2012/06/18/django-administration-interface-non-staff-users/, how about *subclassing* the admin site!


Some useful stuff/documentation/tutorial fodder
===============================================
Create superuser fast:
$ python manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com


Design documentation, etc.
==========================
* Will be customizing admin interface for both end-users and admin-users. So, taking
the example of change form showing book info: a regular site user will not be
able to edit author, title, etc., but admin user  *would* see those fields
as editable (though they of course would not see the vote numbers fields as
editable)
